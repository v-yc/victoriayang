Hi! My name is Victoria, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing a double major in microbiology and environmental studies at UC Santa Barbara. My goal is to use microbiology to innovate solutions to environmental issues, and I am currently working with Nereid Biomaterials in the Santoro Lab to create marine-degradable plastics. In my free time, I love to spend time with my dogs, hang out with friends, and play all kinds of sports!
