### Projects/ skills/ interests that I want to highlight:

1.  Nereid Biomaterials

    -   This is a project that I've been working on for almost a year in the Santoro Lab. The goal of the project is to isolate and analyze the genomes of marine microorganisms that develop a type of plastic called PHB.
    -   I am planning to include a brief section on this in the About page of my website since I am not sure if pictures or any details are confidential information.

2.  Hobbies!

    -   I want to include some of my hobbies (art, spending time with my dogs, etc) so that people can get to know me better outside of work
    -   I am planning to do this by incorporating a section under the Nereid Biomaterials section on the About page.
