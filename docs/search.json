    "text": "I am working in the Santoro Lab with the Nereid Biomaterials team to isolate and analyze the genomes of microorganisms that degrade a type of plastic called polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).\nThere are no available options for biodegradable plastics that degrade in ocean environments because common biodegradable plastics like PLA require high heat conditions in industrial facilities to degrade. The goal of this project is to enhance our current understanding of PHB-degrading bacteria in marine environments to ultimately develop sustainable material alternatives."
